Design and build a drone with camera and a lightweight robotic arm.

# Drone with Camera and Robotic Arm

## Overview
This project focuses on the design and construction of a drone equipped with a camera and a lightweight robotic arm. 
The system is intended to be developed in stages, starting with a manually controlled drone and progressively adding 
features as a robotic arm.
## Motivation
I am interested in robotics. 
This project allows me to explore systems-level engineering, integration of hardware and software, and real-world design tradeoffs.

## Planned Development Phases
1. Build and stabilize a manually controlled drone
2. Integrate an onboard camera for video capture or streaming
3. Design and attach a lightweight robotic arm
4. Implement basic object detection
5. Explore semi-autonomous object interaction

## Design Priorities
- Modularity and expandability  
- Weight and power efficiency  
- Clear documentation of design decisions and failures  

## Current Status
Phase 1 – Planning and component selection
